        <h2>Republicanism</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Modern republicanism is a guiding political philosophy of the United States that has be  en a major part of American civic thought since its founding. It stresses liberty and inalienable individual rights as central values, it recognizes the sovereignty of the people as the source of all authority in law; rejects monarchy, aristocracy and hereditary political power, expects citizens to be virtuous and faithful in their performance of civic duties, and vilifies corruption.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Monarchy</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A monarchy is a form of government in which a person, the monarch, is head of state for life or until abdication. The political legitimacy and governing power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to restricted (constitutional monarchy), to fully autocratic (absolute monarchy), combining executive, legislative and judicial power.</p>
        <h2>Communism</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Communism (from Latin communis, "common, universal") is a philosophical, social, political, economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.</p>
        <h2>Dictatorship</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A dictatorship is a form of government characterized by a single leader or group of leaders and little or no toleration for political pluralism or independent programs or media. According to other definitions, democracies are regimes in which "those who govern are selected through contested elections"; therefore dictatorships are "not democracies". With the advent of the 19th and 20th centuries, dictatorships and constitutional democracies emerged as the world's two major forms of government, gradually eliminating monarchies, one of the traditional widespread forms of government of the time. Typically, in a dictatorial regime, the leader of the country is identified with the title of dictator, although their formal title may more closely resemble something similar to "leader". A common aspect that characterized dictatorship is taking advantage of their strong personality, usually by suppressing freedom of thought and speech of the masses, in order to maintain complete political and social supremacy and stability. Dictatorships and totalitarian societies generally employ political propaganda to decrease the influence of proponents of alternative governing systems.</p>
