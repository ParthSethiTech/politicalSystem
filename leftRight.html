        <h1>What Is Left-wing politics?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Left-wing politics supports social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy. It typically involves a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What Is Right-Wing Politics?</h2>
        <br>
        <p index = "right">Right-wing politics holds the view that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable, typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics, or tradition. Hierarchy and inequality may be viewed as natural results of traditional social differences or the competition in market economies. The term right-wing can generally refer to ’the conservative or reactionary section of a political party or system’.</p>
