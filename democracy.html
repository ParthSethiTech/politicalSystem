        <h1>What is democracy?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Democracy is a form of government in which the people have the authority to choose their governing legislation. Who people are and how authority is shared among them are core issues for democratic theory, development and constitution. Some cornerstones of these issues are freedom of assembly and speech, inclusiveness and equality, membership, consent, voting, right to life and minority rights.</p>

        <h2>Why democracy?</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>A non-democratic govt. may and can respond to the people's need, but it all depends on the wishes of the people who rule. If the rulers don't want to, then they don't have to act. A democracy requires that the rulers have to attend to the needs of the people. Hence, it's a more accountable form of govt</li>
            <li>A democratic decision always involves many people, discussions, consultations and meetings. This takes time, but reduces the chances of rash or irresponsible decisions which further improves the quality of decision-making.</li>
            <li>In a diverse society, people are bound to have differences of opinions and interests. To iron out these differences, democracy is the only known solution as there is no permanent winner and no permanent loser.</li>
            <li>Democracy is based on the principle of political equality i.e. the poorest and the least educated has the same status as that of rich and educated. Thus, it enhances the dignity of citizens.</li>
